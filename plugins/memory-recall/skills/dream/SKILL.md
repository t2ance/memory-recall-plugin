# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream -- a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Your memory directory path is in the auto memory section of your system prompt. Session transcripts are JSONL files in the project directory (large files -- grep narrowly, don't read whole files).

---

## Phase 1 -- Orient

- `ls` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read `MEMORY.md` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- If `logs/` or `sessions/` subdirectories exist, review recent entries there

## Phase 2 -- Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Daily logs** (`logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) if present -- these are the append-only stream
2. **Existing memories that drifted** -- facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
3. **Transcript search** -- if you need specific context (e.g., "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms. Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 -- Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section -- it's the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts -- if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 -- Prune and index

Update `MEMORY.md` so it stays under 200 lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump -- each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: `- [Title](file.md) -- one-line hook`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file -- shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions -- if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

Return a brief summary of what you consolidated, updated, or pruned. If nothing changed (memories are already tight), say so.
